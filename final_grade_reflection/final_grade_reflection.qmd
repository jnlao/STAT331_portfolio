I believe I've earned an A in this class. I've met an A-level requirements through my demonstration of understanding of all the class learning targets, submitting full attempts by the due-date for every assignment, revising my assignments and thinking on future assignments, extending my thinking through completing challenges, being a collaborative and inclusive team member, and reviewing my peers' code as thoughtfully and best I can.

The learning targets I've shown my understanding of are: **WD-1** through data_imports_practice, **WD-2** through lab 7 question 5, **WD-3** and **WD-6** through lab 4 question 2, WD-4 through lab 3 question 4, **WD-5** through challenge 4 question 7, **WD-7** through lab 4 questions 9 and 10, **R-1** and **R-2** through lab 4 (and every other submission), **R-3** through lab 7 question 5, **DVS-1**, **DVS-2**, and **DVS-3** through lab 4 question 10, **DVS-4** through lab 3 question 5, **DVS-5** through lab 5 question 3, **DVS-6** through lab 9 question 2, **DVS-7** through challenge 9 question 11, **PE-1** and **PE-3** through lab 3 question 5, **PE-2** through lab 8 question 4, **PE-4** through lab 4 question 9, **DSM-1** through practice activity 9 question 6, and **DSM-2** through lab 9 question 6.

I've demonstrated a commitment to continued learning through retrying and resubmitting my assignments when given the chance. I've resubmitted assignments like challenges 3, 4, and 7 as well as labs 3 and 7 until I'm able to receive an "S" on all aspects of the assignments. Because I want these assignments to reflect my full effort and commitment, I always aim to edit and resubmit my assignments that have a grade of "G". I've also found myself searching the internet for new ways to improve certain aspects of my plots and have found multiple ways to edit and personalize them to my liking. I've gotten suggestions to improve the formatting of my code to make it more human-readable and displaying my data as a way to provide evidence for my analysis and I believe I've been doing a good job of keeping them in mind on the following assignments. My challenge assignments are always submitted as full attempts and though they can take some time and be more frustrating than the practice assignments or labs, I always find myself learning more and expanding on my knowledge of R. 

As a team member, I believe I'm always open and eager to collaborate with my team members on assignments. When we are working in class, I will try to check in and include the other members if we are stuck on a problem or if it seems like the others are struggling. When I'm at home and either I or my group is stuck on a problem, I ask questions on Discord for clarification and reply to others' questions whenever I'm able to help. When it comes to me explaining my reasoning, I always try to keep an open mind and be receptive to any disagreements anyone may have because I know that I, too, can make mistakes. I believe I've fostered an inclusive and welcoming environment for our class. I love hearing and including everyone in conversations and creating an environment that everyone feels comfortable in. I'm mindful and respectful of everyone's place through their personal journeys, whether it be their personal or academic journey. To elaborate, everyone works and learns at different paces and in places where I think something is easy, doesn't mean it's easy or as simple for everyone else and vice versa. With this in mind, I aim to be mindful when asking questions or giving advice or help. Similarly, everyone is at different places of their own personal development and journey and can be going through something I have no idea about. I try to always approach everyone with an open mind and I aim to always respect one's sexuality, pronouns, gender expression, gender identity, and anything else that they entrust to me.

When it comes to peer reviewing, I will admit it's slipped my mind; however when I find my way back to it, I put in complete effort into reviewing my peers' code. As someone who is still learning how to receive constructive criticism from others, I try my best to be firm yet gentle when giving any code or formatting suggestions.
