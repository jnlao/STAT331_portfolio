## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

```

```{r}
#| label: load data
#| message: false

hiphop <- read_csv(here::here("labs", "lab3", "revision", "hiphop.csv"))

```

## Summary

1\) The dataset contains results from a study to predict musical taste based on African American English (AAE). Of a group of 168 subjects, each one was asked to define 64 AAE terms and based on these definitions, a "familiarity" score of 1-5 was created- 1 being no familiarity and 5 being well familiarity. The dataset provides information on the subjects such as: sex, age, and ethnicity; the AAE terms and subject's familiarity scores; and related social network variables.

2\) The rows of this dataset are the AAE words listed 64 times for each 168, which gives a row dimension of 10752.

3\) If a subject didn't provide a city or country, the population number was substituted by 0. The benefits of this is that the researchers don't have to estimate a general number to make up for the lack of population, which will help the data to stay as accurate to the actual information as possible. However, a drawback of this is that though the data is accurate to the given data, it is not completely correct since it doesn't account for the subject's actual city and country populations.

Moreover, missing values were replaced with mean values. This could benefit the study because using mean values gives a "good" general value to be able to continue the study without missing information, however, because it was just a general value, it can influence and cause the outcome data to be inaccurate.

## 4) Clean the Dataset

```{r}
#| label: cleaning the dataset
#| message: false

hiphop_cleaned <- hiphop |> 
  #   drop_na(numPreferredArtists,  numOverallArtists) |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))

```

## 5) How Many Unique AAE Words Are Used?

```{r}
#| label: count unique AAE words
#| message: false

AAE_words <- distinct(hiphop_cleaned, word, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
  count()
```

There are 64 unique AAE words used.

## 6) Re-categorizing "ethnic"

```{r}
#| label: re-categorizing "ethnic"
#| message: false

hiphop_recat <- hiphop_cleaned |> 
  mutate(ethnic = if_else(ethnic != "white", "non-white", "white"))

```

## 7) What are the demographics of the people in this study?

```{r}
#| label: demographics
#| message: false

demographics <- hiphop_cleaned |> 
  distinct(subj, sex, age, ethnic)
  
summary(demographics)

```

After dropping all participants who answered "NA", the majority of the participants were female (56), with only 24 males. The average age of the participants were 19 years old and mostly white, with asian ethnicities following behind.

## 8) Demographic Plots

```{r}
#| label: demographic plots
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

ggplot(data = demographics,
  mapping = aes(x = ethnic)) +
  xlab("ethnicity of subject") +
       ylab("subject count") +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(data = demographics,
  mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  xlab("age of subject") +
       ylab("subject count") +
  geom_bar()
```

## Familiar Words

### a) people below the age of 20

```{r}
#| label: a) below age 20

below20 <- hiphop_recat |>  
  filter(age < 20) |> 
  group_by(word) |>
  summarize(avg_familiarity = mean(familiarity))
below20_min <- below20 |> 
  slice_min(order_by = avg_familiarity, n = 5)
below20_max <- below20|> 
  slice_max(order_by = avg_familiarity, n = 5)
  
```

whiteMen_above30_min <- whiteMen_above30 |> 
  slice_min(order_by = avg_familiarity)
whiteMen_above30_max <- whiteMen_above30 |> 
  slice_max(order_by = avg_familiarity, n = 5)

## Study Subjects

```{r}
#| label: study subjects
#| message: false

possibly_bieber <- hiphop |> 
  distinct(subj, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  filter(
    sex == 'Male',
    ethnic == 'white',
    city > 10000,
    city < 60000,
    age > 17,

# p17 named the most bieber songs while meeting all requirements!

```

I believe subject p17 is secretly Justin Bieber.
